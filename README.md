from the Supplementary Multilingual Plane have been added:

* ùüô U+1D7D8 MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE STRUCK DIGIT ZERO through ùü° U+1D7E1 MATHEMATICAL DOUBLE STRUCK DIGIT NINE.

## Explanation

For historical reasons, the full set of circled digits and numerals from zero through 50 
has been encoded in several different blocks in Unicode and system-installed fonts do not 
typically cover the entire range. In terminal environments, this often leads to inconsistent 
rendering as the font layout engine pulls glyphs from disparate fonts with partial coverage.

In addition, Unicode only encodes up to numeral 50. There are many cases where we would like
to have broader coverage.
